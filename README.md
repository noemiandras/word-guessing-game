**Goal of the Project:**
<br />
Demonstrate a hangman style game where independent users are logged onto the same server as separate clients. 


**Tools Used:**  
```
Java, JavaFX
```

**Description:**
<br />
The project is a summer themed Hangman Style Game, where each user can pick in between three categories to guess the word from. Each user is implemented as a client thread that runs concurrently as it communicates with the server thread. The server contains all the game logic, while the client displays the state of the game.
